// for a single branch and decides which files should be upgraded, split (with split times) or compacted.
// classification can decide to ignore some files for this round (putting them in files_to_keep), but
// that's generally the result of split|compact decisions.  Files not needing considered for action in
// this round were already filtered out before we get to classification.
